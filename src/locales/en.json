This reflects the diversity of opportunities and the integration of roles in developing the city, stemming from the university's position as one of the first universities globally to offer specialized academic programs in international tourism and hospitality.\n\nThe event also targets complementary groups with direct impact, including entrepreneurs and innovators, companies and the private sector, those interested in culture, heritage, and hospitality, as well as investors in tourism and services, to support an integrated dialogue that connects ideas with reality and contributes to creating a sustainable impact in partnership with relevant entities."
